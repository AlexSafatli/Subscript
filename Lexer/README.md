Lexical Analyser
===============

Implemented using an approach of reading the techniques specified in [The Dragon Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools) in Chapter 3 for building a lexical analyser (lexer) alongside review of undergraduate course content and the tutorial present in a series by Jack Crenshaw called "[Let's Build a Compiler!](http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/)".

Very object-oriented in construction, sacrificing efficiency for clarity in the initial pass. Once a functional lexer has been put together, another pass will involve restructuring data structures to reduce complexity and make more efficient.
